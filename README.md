# This project doesn't work and is no longer maintained
It's really cool to see people discovering this but just to end the confusion, you don't need this to implement gbuffers in Raylib anymore. 

# If you're running an ancient version of Raylib for some reason and still *really* need gbuffers
1. Don't use this.
2. You're going to need to patch rlgl.h with the version found in my gists.
3. Good luck.
